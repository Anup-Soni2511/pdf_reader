INTRODUCTION \n \nInformation \nSystems \n(IS) \nprograms \nhave \ncontinually incorporated contemporary concepts \nand technologies to prepare students for the \ncomplex business and technology environment \n(Bell, Mills, & Fadel, 2013; Topi, Valacich, Wright, \nKaiser, Numamaker Jr. & Sipior, 2010). The \nadvent of the big data era in recent years has \nspawned an increasing demand for business \nanalytics skills and talents. To remain relevant \nand successful in this fast-growing market, many \nIS programs have adjusted their curricula to \ninclude more business analytics focused courses \n(Clayton & Clopton, 2019; Hilgers, Stanley, Elrod, \n& Flachsbart, 2015; Holoman, 2018; Sidorova, \n2013; Wymbs, 2016). A common trend has been \nthe shift from Java programming courses to \nPython programming courses. Because of its \nsimplicity, flexibility, and availability of many \nlibraries for data analysis, Python has become a \nwidely used language for business analytics, \nmarketing analytics, finance analytics, and many \nother \napplication \ndomains \nrequiring \ndata \nanalytics. Python is ranked the world\u2019s most \npopular coding language by IEEE (Cass, 2018) \nand was named the \u201cLanguage of the Year\u201d of \n2018 by the Application Development Trends \nMagazine (Ramel, 2019).  \n",

This paper is motivated by the IS \ndiscipline\u2019s dedication to maintaining relevance \n(Agarwal & Lucas, 2005; Baskerville & Myers, \n2002; Benbasat & Zmud, 2003; Robey, 1996) \nand, more specifically, by the surging demand for \nincluding Python programming into the curricula \nof business schools or IS programs specializing in \nbusiness analytics. We intend to address two \nresearch questions:  \n\u2022 RQ1: How do IS and business students perceive \nthe relevance of Python programming to their \nfuture career? \n\u2022 RQ2: What factors impact the students\u2019 \nperceptions of learning outcomes and their actual \nperformance? \nTo \naddress \nthese \nresearch \nquestions, \nwe \nconducted a survey study and collected responses \nfrom 64 undergraduate students who took an \nintroductory Python programming course at a \nbusiness school of a northeastern U.S. university. \nWe expect that students\u2019 positive perceptions of \nthe relevance and learning outcomes may \nencourage enrollment in programming and other \nIS courses and help promote IS programs.  \n2. LITERATURE REVIEW \n \nBusiness Analytics in IS Curriculum \nTo maintain relevance to the ever changing, \nincreasingly complex technological and business \nenvironment, the Association for Information \nSystems (AIS) has developed a series of model \ncurricula for graduate and undergraduate IS \nprograms \n(Gorgone, \nDavis, \nValacich, \nTopi, \nFeinstein & Longenecker Jr., 2002; Topi, Helfert, \nRamesh & Wigand, 2011; Topi et al., 2010). \nHowever, \nbecause \nof \nvarious \nconstraints, \nadhering to a standard model curriculum (Bell et \nal., 2013) is often difficult for all IS programs, and \na more specialized curriculum may help IS \nprograms seize market opportunities, maintain \nrelevance, and address various challenges such \nas declining enrollment (Sidorova, 2013).  \n \nThe emergence of data science and data analytics \nhas \nbrought \nabout \nincreased \ninterest \nin \nintroducing coding to non-computer science \nmajors (Holoman, 2018; Silveyra, 2019; Wilder & \nOzgur, 2015). Many IS programs have already \nimplemented \nbusiness \nanalytics-oriented \ncurricula in order to keep IS education relevant in \na data-centric business environment. Among the \nbusiness analytics skills recommended by prior \nstudies (Gupta, Goul, & Dinter 2015; Hilgers et \nal., 2015; Wymbs, 2016), programming has \nrepeatedly been identified as an essential skill. \nAlthough application development was removed \nfrom the core of IS 2010 model curriculum (Topi \net al., 2010), over 80 percent of the IS programs \nsurveyed still kept programming courses in their \ncurriculum core (Bell et al., 2013). This reflects \nthe belief of many IS educators that programming \nremains an important topic and that, although \nsoftware development may no longer be a typical \ncareer choice for IS graduates, programming is a \nvery useful skill for future business professionals. \n \nLearning and Teaching Programming \nOur RQ2 concerns learning outcomes. A large \nbody \nof \nresearch \nthat \ninvestigates \nthe \npsychological and cognitive processes of learning \nto program and their impacts on learning \noutcomes (e.g., teaching effectiveness and \nindividual performance) can be found in the \nliterature of computer science (CS) education. \nThe main finding in the literature is that learning \noutcomes can be affected by various factors \nincluding learners\u2019 cognitive development levels, \nlearning styles, motivations, background, prior \nexperience, \nand \nlearning \ncontext \nand \nenvironment \n(Lau \n& \nYuen, \n2009; \nRobins, \nRountree & Rountree, 2003; Shaw, 2012; Tie & \nUmar, 2010; White & Sivitanides, 2002). Roughly \nspeaking, these factors can be grouped into three \ncategories: individual characteristics, language \ncharacteristics, and context characteristics.  \nIndividual Characteristics \nPrior research has long studied the impact of \nindividual characteristics on the outcomes of \nlearning to program. One of the important \ncharacteristics \nis \nan \nindividual\u2019s \ncognitive \ndevelopment level (Mayer, Dyck & Vilberg 1989). \nThe cognitive development theory (Piaget, 1972) \nidentifies three age-related development levels: \npre-operational (2 \u2013 7 years), concrete (7 \u2013 12 \nyears), and operational (12 years and above). \nThe operational level requires abilities to abstract, \nform hypothesis, and solve complex problems \n(Biehler \n& \nSnowman, \n1986). \nWhite \nand \nSivitanides (2002) posited that an individual\u2019s \ncognitive \ndevelopment \nlevel \npredicts \nher \nprogramming performance and that different \nlanguages require different cognitive levels. For \nexample, scripting and markup languages (e.g., \nHTML) require lower levels than object-oriented \nlanguages (e.g., Java and C++). Studies have \nfound that an individual\u2019s learning style can also \naffect her performance in learning to program \n",
        "Information Systems Education Journal (ISEDJ) \n \n19 (4) \nISSN: 1545-679X \n \nAugust 2021 \n \n\u00a92021 ISCAP (Information Systems and Computing Academic Professionals)                                           \n Page 39 \nhttps://isedj.org/; https://iscap.info \n \n(Lau & Yuen, 2009; Shaw, 2012; Tie & Umar, \n2010). Perkins, Hancock, Hobbs, Martin & \nSimmons (1989) identified two types of learners, \nstoppers and movers, differentiated by their \nattitudes and behaviors when encountering a \nproblem or a lack of direction to proceed. \nStoppers often have a negative emotional \nreaction to errors and problems and cease to try; \nwhile movers continue to try, search, experiment, \nand revise. Research has also investigated the \nimpacts of many other individual characteristics. \nFor example, individuals with strong motivations \noften commit themselves to performing well and \nto \nacquiring \nthe \nskill \n(Pendergast, \n2006). \nAdditionally, several studies have focused on the \ngender effect because of the dominance of male \nprogrammers in the information technology \nsector (Lau & Yuen, 2009; Underwood, G., \nMcCaffrey, M., & Underwood 1990; Yau & Cheng, \n2012) and reported mixed findings. \nAlthough CS education research has accumulated \na significant body of knowledge about learning \nand teaching programming, only a limited \nnumber \nof \nstudies \nin \nthe \nIS \nliterature \n(Pendergast, 2006; Roussev, 2003; Urbaczewski \n& Wheeler, 2001; Zhang, Zhang, Stafford, & \nZhang, 2013). can be found to focus on teaching \nbusiness students how to program. Business \nstudents are different from CS students in many \naspects (e.g., motivations, background, and \nperceptions of relevance). For this research \nquestion (RQ2), we propose our first hypothesis \nas \nH1: A student\u2019s individual characteristics have a \nsignificant impact on the student\u2019s perceived \nlearning outcomes and actual performance. \nThe \nliterature \nhas \nalso \nshown \nthat \nprior \nprogramming \nexperience \naffects \nstudents' \nperceived learning and outcomes. (Bergin & \nReilly, 2005; Bowman, Jarratt, Culver, and Segre, \n2019). Students' perception of understanding a \ntopic has the strongest correlation with their \nprogramming \nperformance, \nand \ntheir \nown \nexperience is related to how well they understood \nthe concepts and their level of confidence their \nown work. Given this research, we propose our \nsecond hypothesis as \nH2: A student\u2019s prior experience of programming \nhas a significant impact on the student\u2019s \nperceived \nlearning \noutcomes \nand \nactual \nperformance.  \n \n \nLanguage Characteristics \nIn the history of programming languages, several \ntypes with different language characteristics have \nemerged, ranging from procedural (e.g., COBOL \nand C), OO (object-oriented, e.g., Java and \nC++), scripting (e.g., JavaScript), to visual (e.g., \nVisual Basic). Since the 1990s, Java has been a \ndominant language for teaching introductory \nprogramming (Shein, 2015). As a scripting \nlanguage, \nPython \nis \nadvantageous \nfor \nits \nsimplicity in syntax and flexibility in data \nstructures, and has become more popular in \nrecent \nyears \nin \nintroductory \nprogramming \ncourses (Shein, 2015). Based on these findings, \nwe posit in this research that \nH3: A student\u2019s perceptions of the language \ncharacteristics of Python have a significant impact \non the student\u2019s perceived learning outcomes and \nactual performance.  \nContext Characteristics \nLearning context is a multi-faceted construct and \nmay vary in terms of type (e.g., orienting context, \ninstructional context, and transfer context) and \nlevel (learner, immediate environment, and \norganizational) (Tessmer & Richey, 1997). An \nindividual\u2019s perception of the learning context \nmay have a profound impact on his/her learning \nexperience (Ramsden, 2005). The course design \n(e.g., lectures and topics) and study process can \naffect students\u2019 understanding of the concepts \nand performance in a Java programming course \n(Govender, 2009). Similarly, different teaching \napproaches (lecture + exercise vs. lecture-only) \nhave been found to result in different student \nperformance in an introductory C programming \ncourse in an IS program (Zhang et al., 2013). The \nliterature has also reported the impacts of other \ncontextual factors. This research focuses on the \nimpact of course design in terms of topics and \nhomework assignments. We hypothesize that  \nH4: A student\u2019s perception of the course design \nhas a significant impact on the student\u2019s \nperceived \nlearning \noutcomes \nand \nactual \nperformance. \n3. COURSE DESIGN \n \nThe introductory Python programming course is \nan elective for undergraduate CIS (Computer \nInformation Systems) majors and minors at a \nnortheastern \nU.S. \nbusiness \nuniversity. \nUndergraduate CIS majors are required to take a \nsemester course in Java programming (Java I) \nand can choose to take an advanced Java \nprogramming course (Java II) as an elective. \n",

This Python course \nhas no prerequisites other than an introductory IT \ncourse required of all first-year students, and \nrecently has become a prerequisite for the \nIntroduction to Data Science course offered \nthrough the Mathematics department.   \nThis course met for two 80-minute sessions each \nweek in a 14-week semester.  Each class session \nincluded \ninstructor-led \nlectures \nor \ndemonstrations, \nand \noften \nshort, \nin-class \nexercises that reinforced the topics presented. \nOne instructor taught two sections; the other \ntaught one section. All sections used the same \nsyllabus and shared common assignments and \nexams. \nThe evaluation of student performance consisted \nof seven programming assignments (40% of the \ngrade), lab participation (5%), midterm exam \n(25%), and final exam (30%). Table 1 in \nAppendix 2 presents the topics covered and the \nseven homework assignments. Table 2 in \nAppendix 2 shows the grade distribution across \nthree sections of the course. The average grade \nwas 2.7/4.0.  \nThis course presents basic programming concepts \nand techniques using Python 3, including loops \nand selection statements; data structures (e.g., \nlists and dictionaries); classes, and objects. \nInstructors omitted advanced topics such as \nhigher order functions (e.g., map, reduce, filter, \nlambda), and other topics frequently taught in \nJava programming courses (e.g., graphics and \nuser interface design), teaching instead, basic \ncapabilities of several popular Python libraries for \ndata analysis: NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas. \nIncluding data analytics topics in an introductory \nPython programming course is a relatively new \nphenomenon, as evidenced by the lack of \nintroductory textbooks from major publishers \ncontaining this content.  Table 3 in Appendix 2 \nlists popular introductory Python textbooks from \nmajor publishers. These texts have a computer \nscience focus and include advanced programming \ntopics \nsuch \nas \nrecursion, \ninheritance \nand \npolymorphism. Case studies or coding examples \non graphical user interfaces,  graphics processing, \noperating systems, or client server programming \nare less relevant to information systems students \nlearning Python because of their interest in data \nscience or data analytics. On the other hand, \nreference textbooks teaching data science topics \ngenerally assume prior programming experience. \nIn addition to a standard Python textbook, we \nused online documentation for reference when \nteaching data analytics topics, and had students \ninteract with examples and materials in the same \nway that professional developers might use these \nresources. This approach ensures the analytics \nexamples use current versions of those modules \nand minimizes the burden on instructors to create \na plethora of new materials. A homework \nassignment had students use functions from the \nthree analytics libraries to perform simple text \nanalysis of a sample of tweets.  \n4. RESEARCH METHODS \n \nSurvey Methodology \nTo answer our research questions, we used the \nsurvey methodology to collect data from the three \nsections of this course. A pre-course survey was \nadministered in the first week of the semester \nand a post-course survey in the last week before \nthe final exam. The pre-course questionnaire \nconsists \nof \nquestions \nabout \nthe \nstudent \ndemographics, background, prior programming \nexperience, and motivations to take the course. \nThe post-course survey includes questions about \nstudents\u2019 attitudes and opinions about the course \ndesign (topics and homework assignments), their \nlearning styles, and perceived outcomes of this \ncourse.  \nAssignments and exams were standardized \nacross all instructors and sections. The 70 \nstudents who enrolled in the three sections were \ninvited to take the pre- and post-course surveys. \nBoth surveys were administered online where \nstudents\u2019 emails were captured by the survey \nwebsite \n(Qualtrics) \nthrough \nindividualized \ninvitation links sent to students\u2019 email accounts. \nHowever, students were assured that their \nresponses would not be accessed before their \ngrades were posted to remove the social \ndesirability bias (Campbell & Standley, 1963).   \nAmong these students, 36 out of 70 (51.4%) are \nmale and 34 (48.5%) are female. The mean age \nis 20.8 years. The majority of the students are \nseniors (n = 39, 55.7%) or juniors (n = 26, \n37.1%) and only 6 (8.6%) students are \nsophomores and one student is a freshman. The \nlarge number of seniors is attributed to seniors \nhaving priority to register for the class first. \nStudents majored in different business disciplines \nincluding CIS (n = 27, 38.6%), Finance (n = 15, \n21.4%), Actuarial Science (n = 9, 12.9%), and \nother business majors such as Accounting, \nMarketing, Management, etc. (n = 17, 24.3%). \nTwo students had not declared their majors by \n",

Fifty-six \nstudents (80%) indicated that they had prior \nexperience \nof \nat \nleast \none \nprogramming \nlanguage, including Scratch, VB, JavaScript, Java, \nC++, or C#. The numbers of students who had \ntaken Java I and Java II are 37 (52.9%) and 11 \n(15.7%), respectively. In addition, 28 students \n(40%) had taken a web development course \nusing HTML and JavaScript.  \nSix of the returned responses were incomplete \nwith \nmissing \nanswers \nto \nsome \nimportant \nquestions and therefore removed from the study. \nThe resulting sample consisted of 64 valid \nresponses. \nVariables and Measures \nIndependent variables used in this study are \ngrouped \ninto \nthree \ncategories: \nindividual \ncharacteristics, language characteristics, and \ncourse design (context) characteristics. Tables 1 \nand 2 in Appendix 1 list the variables and \ncorresponding items in the pre- and post- survey \nquestionnaires.  \nIndividual characteristic variables include gender, \nyear, number of motivations (#motivs), number \nof prior programming languages (#prior_langs), \nand three dummy variables representing whether \na student had taken Java I (Java_1), Java II \n(Java_2), and the Web Development (HTML) \ncourses, respectively. As students grow and \nbecome more mature over their four years of \ncollege, we use a student\u2019s age and year (i.e., \nfreshman, sophomore, junior, and senior) to \napproximately \nrepresent \nhis/her \ncognitive \ndevelopment level. The number of motivations is \ncaptured by a pre-course survey item asking \nstudents their motivation to take the course with \nfour non-exclusive options: \u201cto increase my \ncareer opportunities\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m interested in the \ntopic\u201d, \u201cI will use Python in my own business in \nthe future,\u201d and other (specify). The pre-course \nsurvey \nalso \nasks \nstudents \nto \ncheck \nany \nprogramming \nlanguages \nthey \nhad \nlearned \npreviously (e.g., Scratch, VB, JavaScript, Java, \netc.). \nTo assess individual learning style, a survey item \nasks students, when encountering a problem or \nan error, how frequently (sum to 100%) they \nwould (a) ask the instructor for help, (b) visit the \nCIS learning center, (c) ask other classmates, (d) \nsolve by themselves, or (e) search online. The \ntotal from (a)-(c) is calculated as an indicator \n(style_stopper) for the extent to which a student \nis a \u201cstopper\u201d (Perkins et al., 1989).  \nThe language characteristic group includes two \nvariables measured by two 5-point Likert scale \nquestions in the post-course survey: perceived \ndifficulty of Python syntax (syntax) and the \nperceived difficulty of programming logic (logic).  \nThe independent variables in the context group \nregarding the course design are perceived \nusefulness \nof \nthe \ntopics \n(topics_useful), \nperceived \nrelevance \nof \nthe \ntopics \n(topics_relevant), perceived helpfulness of the \nhomework \nassignments \n(hw_helpful), \nand \nperceived difficulty of homework (hw_difficult). \nThe averages of the scores for the topics and \nhomework assignments by each student are used \nfor the values of these variables.  \nThe control variables include age, section, major, \nperceived \noverall \ndifficulty \nof \nthe \ncourse \n(course_difficult), \nand \nstudent \nself-reported \naverage number of hours spent on this course in \neach week (hours_spent). Also used as a control \nvariable, \nPython_relevant, \nis \na \nstudent\u2019s \nperceptions of the overall relevance of Python \nmeasured by a group of six 5-point Likert scale \nquestions (ranging from strongly disagree to \nstrongly agree) in the post-course survey. The \naverage of the six scores by each student is used \nfor the value of this variable.  \nThe two dependent variables are a student\u2019s \nperceived outcomes (outcomes) and the actual \nperformance (grade). The perceived outcomes \nare captured in the post-course survey using a set \nof four 5-point Likert scale questions and \nmeasured using the average of the four scores \n(see Appendix). The student grade is a value \nbetween 0 and 100.  \nThe post-semester survey also included open-\nended questions on the delivery of this course and \nsuggestions for future semesters. \n 4. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS \nPerceived Relevance  \nTo address the first research question (RQ1) \nabout the perceived relevance of the Python \nprogramming course, we performed descriptive \nanalysis of the responses from the surveys. The \npost-survey items regarding the overall relevance \n(Python_relevant) and the relevance of specific \ntopics (topics_relevant) were used to assess \nstudents\u2019 perceptions (see Table 4 in Appendix 2). \nThe scores range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 \n(strongly agree). The first data column in Table 4 \npresents the means (and standard deviations) of \nthese variables for all students. \n",
